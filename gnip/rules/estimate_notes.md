#  Notes

## US debates
	- Only one pull almost reached the 8M mark.
	- OR vs ALL:
		- First round used one rule per term, which I'm assuming pulls "eveything" by each term. To reduce size, we could
			- Use an "OR" approach. This would allow up to 30 OR conditions per rule. We could either:
				- Have two sep rules, one for tags and one for keywords
				- Limit the number of terms of each list to 30 terms max.
			- Limit lang to only 'en' and 'es'

## 02/21

- US debates top users: too many users to run @, to, from, retweet_of rules together. Run separately? (this would add 8 more filtered days)
